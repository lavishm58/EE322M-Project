### Abstract
Clustering is widely used in unsupervised machine learning to separate data. Hierarchical clustering
is a method which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters in the data. However, this is a slow algorithm with a 
time complexity of O(N <sup>3</sup> ). In this project our aim is to develope a fast clustering mechanism 
for binary separation of data at nodes of decision tree.

### Introduction

Decision tree learning is a supervised machine learning approach that uses a decision tree to go from decision on observation values(branches)
to conclusion about item's target class (leaves) . Trees provides high accuracy, stability and ease of interpretation in classification problems.
