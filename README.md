### Abstract
Clustering is widely used in unsupervised machine learning to separate data. Hierarchical clustering
is a method which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters in the data. However, this is a slow algorithm with a 
time complexity of O(N<sup>3</sup>). In this project our aim is to develope a fast clustering mechanism 
for binary separation of data at nodes of decision tree.

###Introduction

Decision tree learning is a supervised machine learning approach that uses a decision tree , which goes from decision on observation values(branches)
to conclusion about item's target class (leaves) .
