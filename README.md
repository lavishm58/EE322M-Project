## Fast hierarchical clustering to Arrange Data

### Abstract
Clustering is widely used in unsupervised machine learning to separate data. Hierarchical clustering
is a method which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. However this is a slow algorithm with a 
time complexity of O(N<sup>3</sup>). In this project our aim is to develope a fast clustering mechanism 
for binary separation of data at nodes of decision tree.
